# web-reader-landing-page

## Setup

### Dependencies

* `npm` and `gulp` installed
* Having `go` installed and having `$GOPATH` env var set.

go requires a directory to use for the $GOPATH. go will install dependencies there.
E.g. `mkdir ~/dev/gopath; export GOPATH=~/dev/gopath`

Run `go get -u github.com/NYPL-Simplified/webpub-exporter` to download and build the exporter in your $GOPATH.

### Setup

* Install [virtualenv](http://pythoncentral.io/how-to-install-virtualenv-python/).
* Run `virtualenv env` to create the sandboxed virtualenv.
* Run `source ./env/bin/activate`
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` to bring in the web reader.
* Run `npm install` to install `gulp` used to compile SCSS and minify CSS and JS.

### Uploading to S3

Follow the instructions at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html to install and configure the aws cli.

To upload an output directory to an s3 bucket, run

`aws s3 cp output s3://bucket-name/ --recursive --acl public-read --cache-control max-age=300 --profile your-aws-cli-profile-name`

Note this command is `cp`, not `sync`. This uploads any new or updated files, but does not remove deleted files. Any books that have been removed from the landing page will continue to be available to anyone who has started reading and bookmarked them.
